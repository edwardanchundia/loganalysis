The files in this repo uses Python and SQL queries to generate a report in a text file.

Upon running loganalysis.py in the terminal, the file is set up to hold on to three separate variables that has the fetchall method from each executed query. It then loops through the variables and finds certain objects that is written in a text file. The export.txt can then be open to view the reports.
